# Create File Tool

Creates a new file in the Vercel Sandbox with the specified content.

## Usage

Use this tool to create new files in your project. You need to provide:
- The file path (relative to the current working directory)
- The content to write to the new file

## Examples

### Creating a new JavaScript file
```javascript
// Creating a new utility file
export function formatDate(date) {
  return new Date(date).toLocaleDateString();
}
```

### Creating a new CSS file
```css
.button {
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  padding: 8px 16px;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
```

### Creating a configuration file
```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js"
}
```

## Important Notes

- If a file already exists at the specified path, the creation will fail
- The tool will create any necessary parent directories automatically
- Use appropriate file extensions for proper syntax highlighting and IDE support
- The file path should be relative to the sandbox's current working directory

**Lint/Syntax errors**:
   - Carefully review the Lint/Syntax errors received after saving the file. 
   - You should edit the file to fix the critical errors before proceeding further.
   - You can ignore minor warnings and errors that will not impact functionality.
